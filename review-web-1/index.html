<h3> What the hell is a "moquette"?</h3>

<p> 
The word 'moquette' is a French word for 'carpet', specifically, a carpet meant for upholstery. Moquettes are durable and robust, which makes them the perfect choice for upholstering the seats of public transport.

<p> 
    Moquettes are a part of every day life in London. These varied patterns make up the fabric (pun intended) of London's aesthetic as a city. From the Routemaster red plaid (1959), to the purple and grey of the new Elizabeth Line, moquettes are interesting and important pieces of design.

    The first moquette was named "Lozenge." It was first placed on trams, buses, and trains in the early 1920s (ca. 1923), and was in use until the early 1950s. It was developed by Firth Furnishings Ltd.

<p> This London Transport moquette is the iconic "Routemaster." Introduced in 1959 and featured primarily on London's iconic double-decker buses, its iconic green, brown, red, and yellow-gold remains a favourite despite its discontinuation.</p>
