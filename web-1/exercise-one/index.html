            Silly and queer, someone get me a beer! I like terrible beer (but not <strong>that</strong> terrible),
            making things, surfing, swimming, and writing rude words in funny fonts. I did an entire degree focused on
            the history of eastern Canada <em> (the crowd laughs at my poor choice of degree).</em> Maybe one day, I'll
            get a real-life job that actually pays <em><strong><u>money.</u> &#x1F60E;</strong></em>
